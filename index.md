## Protect Your Noggin

 Many helmets provide protection from skull fractures and serious brain damage, but they fail to prevent minor brain injuries, such as concussions. The Bonk helmet will have you covered for all crashes, no matter how big or small. We even have your back (or shall we say, head) when you don’t fall, as our helmets will keep you ahead of everyone else’s cycling fashion game. Basically, we just want to make sure your noggin stays safe.

### What Your're Really Getting
  1. Assurance that your brain will stay in its designated location and fully functional
  2. A chic helmet to make all your cycling frenemies jealous
  3. Safe travels wherever and whenever your next adventure may lead you
